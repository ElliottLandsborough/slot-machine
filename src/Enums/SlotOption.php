/**
 * Represents the symbols available in the slot machine game.
 * 
 * Each symbol has an associated payout value and weight for random selection.
 * 
 *  - Clarity: Defines all possible symbols in one place.
 *  - Type Safety: Prevents invalid symbols from being used.
 *  - Maintainability: Easy to add or modify symbols in one place.
 *  - Functionality: Encapsulates symbol-related logic (payout, weight) within the enum.
 *  - Easy to map to database/storage if needed.
